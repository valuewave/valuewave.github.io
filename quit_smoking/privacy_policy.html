  <h2>3. Data Storage and Synchronization</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Local Storage</h3>
  <p>
    Your data is primarily stored locally on your device using SQLite database. This ensures the App functions
    offline and provides fast access to your information.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 Cloud Synchronization</h3>
  <p>
    When you create an account and are connected to the internet, your data is synchronized with Firebase Cloud Firestore.
    This allows you to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access your data across multiple devices</li>
    <li>Backup your progress and records</li>
    <li>Restore data if you reinstall the App or change devices</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

  </ul>
  <p>These providers have access to your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.</p>

  <h3>4.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
  <p>We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</p>

  <h3>4.3 Business Transfers</h3>
  <p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred. We will provide notice before your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>

  <p>
    We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your information against
    unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet
